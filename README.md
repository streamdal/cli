# [THIS REPO HAS MOVED!](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal)

CLI tool for [Streamdal](https://streamdal.com)!

> It's like a `tail -f` for your data!

NOTE: This app looks best if you use it in a _modern_ terminal that has TrueColor
support such as iTerm2, Alacrity, Konsole, PowerShell and many, many more.

## Demo
<img src="./assets/demo.gif">

_**OR**_

You can try out the live demo at [demo.streamdal.com](https://demo.streamdal.com).

## Install
Install via homebrew:
```
brew install streamdal/tap/cli
```

_**OR**_

Install manually:

1. Download latest release [here](https://github.com/streamdal/cli/releases)
2. `chmod +x streamdal-darwin-arm64`
3. `mv streamdal-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/streamdal-cli`
4. Verify that it works: `streamdal-cli --version`

_**OR**_

For the brave, install via curl/bash:

`curl -sSL https://sh.streamdal.com/cli | sh`

<sub>This will download the latest release of the CLI and place it in `/usr/local/bin/streamdal-cli`.</sub>

## Usage

Launch the CLI tool by running:

```
$ streamdal-cli --server streamdal-server-address --auth 1234
```

## Environment Variables

You can expose several environment variables to the CLI to save on typing:

| Variable                            | Description                                                  | Default        | Required |  
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| `STREAMDAL_CLI_AUTH`                | Auth token used for communicating with your Streamdal server | None           | **true** |
| `STREAMDAL_CLI_SERVER`              | Server address for your Streamdal server                     | localhost:8082 | **true** |
| `STREAMDAL_CLI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`     | Enable debug log output                                      | 30s            | false | 
| `STREAMDAL_CLI_DISABLE_TLS`         | Disable TLS when talking to Streamdal server                 | false          | false | 
| `STREAMDAL_CLI_DEBUG`               | Enable debug output (only useful if file logging is enabled) | false          | false |
| `STREAMDAL_CLI_ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING` | Enable logging to a file                                     | false          | false |
| `STREAMDAL_CLI_LOG_FILE`            | Filename for the log (only used if file logging is enabled)  | `filename`     | false |
| `STREAMDAL_CLI_MAX_OUTPUT_LINES`    | Disable TLS when talking to Streamdal server                 | 5_000          | false |

You can expose these variables by using `export` and adding them to your `.rc`
file. Alternatively, you can set them in a `.env` file in whichever directory 
you launch the CLI from.

## Release
The process of releasing is semi-automated. You will have to push a new version
tag which will kick off a release Github action and publish a new release on
the [releases](https://github.com/streamdal/cli/releases) page.

You will also need to perform a manual update to the 
[homebrew formula](https://github.com/streamdal/homebrew-tap).
For that, edit `cli.rb`, update `url` and `sha256` for each release and get the
change merged. Verify that new version is available by running 
`brew upgrade streamdal/tap/cli`.
